  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <p>
    As the first state to be accepted to the Code for America fellowship program, Rhode Island brought three fellows in to explore how technology and design thinking can help empower people in the education systems. The State’s Office of Digital Excellence encouraged the fellows to explore areas around parent engagement, highlighting educational resources within the State, preventing brain drain, and supporting those caught on the “wrong side” of the digital divide - among others. The fellows were tasked to find solutions that could be iterated on within one or two school districts, then attempt to scale those solutions across the state.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite its modest population for a state (~1 million), Rhode Island has a large school system, supporting <a href="http://www.ride.ri.gov/StudentsFamilies/RIPublicSchools/SchoolDistricts.aspx">54 public LEAs</a> (Local Education Agencies or districts) -- each with its own challenges. During the month of February, the fellows sought out educators, support staff, education policy makers, education thought leaders, and community members to find common challenges across the state. This resulted in meeting over 150 people, running several focus groups at schools, and generating 180 project ideas (they've been <a href="#projects">narrowed</a> significantly).
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to their interviews in February, the fellows helped launch a Statewide Code for America Brigade and organized Code Across 2014 in Providence. Code Across drew around 60 people from the community including developers, designers, State employees, impassioned community members and Providence’s CIO. The event demonstrated that the RI community was hungry for a way to become involved in civic tech and seeded the Brigade with some initial projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Following February, the team worked on narrowing ideas and creating paper prototypes. They returned to RI in April to conduct IDEO-style focus groups with students, teachers, and administrators. They also met with additional schools districts and support staff (such as social services and secretaries). This led to their primary project focus on electronic student registration.

      <p>
        The Rhode Island Foundation is a philathropic organization that works to make its state better. The organization focuses on improving educational outcomes, improving the economic environment, ensuring access to healthcare, and creating an environment that encourages philanthropy. They are one of the principle funders of this fellowship project.

<div id="strategy" class="section">
  <h1><a name="strategy">Strategy</a></h1>

  <p>
    Part of Code for America's organization brilliance is its willingness to try new things. The Rhode Island fellowship is an experiment in-and-of itself, in that it is the first time a fellowship has been attempted at the state level. Rhode Island may be a small state, but it is still very much a state and not a city.
  </p>
  <p>
    This brings some extra challenges for scalability and adoption of a project:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Larger geographic area to cover</li>
    <li>More organizational layers to consider</li>
    <li>Philosophical debates about what should be operated at the state and local levels</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To address these challenges, the following strategies are being employed:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pilot applications in specific cities before attempting state adoption</li>
    <li>
      Project ideas should focus on specific problem domains as much as possible, limiting the number of stakeholders that need to buy-in
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Additionally, when pairing the broad topics of state government and education, there are many areas that could be tackled: open data, civic engagement, digital services, and much more. However, all of the fellowship team's projects focus on two areas that often go hand-in-hand: relationships and efficiency. All of the projects have the theme of improving the first impression or continuing relationship that residents of Rhode Island have with the school system. The better interactions are created through pleasant user focused interfaces, but also by making these interactions more efficient (for both residents and administrators).

    <h2>Ticket to RIDE</h2>
    <p>
      Making student registration electronic in a whimsical way can help create a better first impression that guardians have with their child's school district. Ticket to RIDE (RIDE = <em>R</em>.<em>I</em>. <em>D</em>epartment of <em>E</em>ducation) is an application that turns the registration forms into a series of prompts to be answered during a train trip. Guardians are prompted for information about their child, themselves, their family situation (such as the need for free/reduced lunch), and the people that are connected to their families.
    </p>

    <h3>Opportunities</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Humanizing Experience</em>: 
        While the current paper forms used get the job done, a colorful and friendly request for registration information is a way to make guardians and their children not seem like numbers in the system. The registration process is an opportunity to start the tone of the family/school relationship in a positive light, especially for guardians that may have felt disenfranchised during their own school years.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Efficiency</em>:
        Depending on the school district, it takes guardians anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes to complete registration forms. Much of this time is spent repeating information across pieces of paper, such as student's name and address. Additionally, school secretaries need between 15 and 20 minutes to transcribe the forms into a Student Information System (SIS). By cutting down on repeat fields and reducing manual data entry, much time can be saved, especially in larger school districts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Standardization</em>:
        Each school district is reponsible for creating its own registration forms, but much of the same information is collected. Standardizing the form via Ticket to RIDE not only removes this burden from individual school districts, but also allows RIDE to collect a consistent and reliable set of information around enrollment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Environmentally/Cost Friendly</em>:
        The Cranston Public Schools enroll about 1000 kindergarteners each year. If there are five pieces of paper in each registration packet, this cuts down the amount of paper used by the school district. And, that's just one school district and one grade level.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Strategy</h3>
    <p>
      The team started by collecting registration packets from several of the largest school districts in Rhode Island and determining what fields are in common on their enrollment forms. Additionally, the schools were consulted to see which pieces of information were left on paper copies and which were transcribed into their SIS. This analysis produced a list of data points that all schools relied on, but also which pieces of information are needed in some districts, but not others (such as Newport that collects military information because of the base in town and their funding). Additionally, the team determined the two most popular SISs used across the state (schools are mandated to use one of three) and identified schools that used them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After creating a high-fidelity prototype, the team returned to Rhode Island to present it to several school districts to see if they'd be interesting in piloting the app and supporting its development through feedback and teaching us about their SIS import processes. Several schools districts agreed to help, including <a href="http://cpsed.net/">Cranston</a>, <a href="http://www.npsri.net/">Newport</a>, and <a href="http://www.westwarwickpublicschools.com/">West Warwick</a> (<a href="http://www.warwickschools.org/">Warwick</a> is a tentative fourth). Additionally, the <a href="http://www.paulcuffee.org/">Paul Cuffee Charter School</a> has offered to help too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strategy going forward includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn the import process used by Aspen and Skyward (the two most populare SISs in RI)</li>
      <li>Identify customizations that schools have made to their SIS data models</li>
      <li>Perform more user testing with guardians</li>
      <li>Complete development of the guardian facing interface based on feedback</li>
      <li>Develop an administrative interface that allows registration verification and export to the schools' SISs</li>
      <li>Determine the project sustainer (either RIDE or RI Office of Digital Excellence)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>MultiplyRI</h2>
    <p><em>

    </em></p>
    <p>
      Chances are if you are reading this, then you know how to use a computer and if you were asked to find computer classes, you might Google for it. Now imagine that you want to take a computer class, but don't possess the skills to search for one online or simply don't have a computer. It's almost a chicken-and-egg problem for those without digital literacy and reveals a problem when trying to point folks without access to digital resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, about <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/mobile-technology-fact-sheet/">90%</a> of adults in the USA have cell phones (~98% of adults 18-49 have cell phones). This presents a large opportunity to reach this population.
    </p>
    <p>
      MultiplyRI is an SMS-based system that allows people with cell phones to locate computers, find a cheap Internet service provider, or locate digital literacy classes by sending a text message containing their address.
    </p>

    <!-- JEFF_TODO Add wireframe image here -->

    <h3>Strategy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop a system that mimics the functionality described</li>
      <li>
        Partner with Broadband RI to create a database of centers offering digital literacy courses and affordable Internet service providers by location
      </li>
      <li>Partner with Sheila Dugan at EveryoneOn to supplement backing data with EveryoneOn's database</li>

    <h2>Charter Lottery Enrollment</h2>
    <p><em>
      This is a potential project, should the fellows find time to do within the space of the fellowship year.
    </em></p>
    <p>
      In Rhode Island, a child's ability to attend a charter school is determined by lottery per school. To make this a more fair process, RIDE has created a standardized lottery sign-up form. However, if a guardian wants to sign up his/her child for multiple lotteries, this form needs to be filled out once for every charter. A quick win is to create an electronic version of this form where a guardian can select multiple schools and their information is entered into the lotteries of his/her choice. This also has efficiency gains in charters not having to do manual data entry of lottery applications.
    </p>

    <h3>Strategy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Gauge interest of this with RIDE</li>
      <li>Create electronic version of the form</li>
      <li>Provide logins for charters to export applicants' data</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Happy Faces</h2>
    <p><em>
      This is a potential project, should the fellows find time to do within the space of the fellowship year.
    </em></p>
    <p>
      One of the prototypes that the team drew up early in the brainstorming process was a simple app that allowed teachers to complete exit surveys of their class. It involved students choosing an emotion (happy, frustrated, sad, excited, etc.) and explaining what about a day's class made them feel this way. Not only does it help teachers gauge the feeling of their class, but it can also help them identify children that are feeling isolated or may need extra help to stay engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea was really well received by focus groups conducted in April, but the uncertainty of who would own such an app within government was unclear and it was not made as the primary focus of the fellowship. During a visit back to RI in June, lots of folks asked about the app and the team may create it as a quick win, despite its unclear future.
    </p>
    <h3>Strategy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Make it</li>
      <li>Deploy it</li>
      <li>See if anyone wants to maintain it</li>
    </ul>

      The Rhode Island fellows deployed Twilio’s emergency response toolkit app for the Providence Student Union. The <a href="http://wordout.us/">WordOut</a> app allows the organizers to broadcast SMS messages to multiple numbers all at once and save them from having to send individual SMS messages during large events such as their recent Walk-to-school event which helped them get legislation passed to decrease the distance boundary for free bus passes for students from 3 miles to 2.5 miles.

    <h2>Project 50 Green</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="http://project50green.herokuapp.com/">Project 50 Green</a> is a web application that serves as an anonymous mental health support group for teens at East Greenwich High School. The app lets the teens have conversations using hashtags via SMS, Twitter and the web. The support group was formed during the Choose2Matter event that the Rhode Island Fellows mentored at during their February residency.

    <h2>Vendors</h2>
    <p>
      During the course of the fellowship thus far, the team has had exposure to many edtech and general tech vendors. Between this and getting a better understanding of school's challenges, this have given the team a unique perspective into which existing products are most apt to suite their needs. This has allowed the team to make suggestions to schools and RIDE.
