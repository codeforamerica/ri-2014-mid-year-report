  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <p>
    As the first state to be accepted to the Code for America fellowship program, Rhode Island brought three fellows in to explore how technology and design thinking can help empower people in the education systems. The State’s Office of Digital Excellence encouraged the fellows to explore areas around parent engagement, highlighting educational resources within the State, preventing brain drain, and supporting those caught on the “wrong side” of the digital divide - among others. The fellows were tasked to find solutions that could be iterated on within one or two school districts, then attempt to scale those solutions across the state.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite its modest population for a state (~1 million), Rhode Island has a large school system, supporting 54 public LEAs (Local Education Agencies or districts) -- each with its own challenges. During the month of February, the fellows sought out educators, support staff, education policy makers, education thought leaders, and community members to find common challenges across the state. This resulted in meeting over 150 people, running several focus groups at schools, and generating 180 project ideas (they've been <a href="#projects">narrowed</a> significantly).
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to their interviews in February, the fellows helped launch a Statewide Code for America Brigade and organized Code Across 2014 in Providence. Code Across drew around 60 people from the community including developers, designers, State employees, impassioned community members and Providence’s CIO. The event demonstrated that the RI community was hungry for a way to become involved in civic tech and seeded the Brigade with some initial projects.

<div id="strategy" class="section">
  <h1><a name="strategy">Strategy</a></h1>

  <p>
    Part of Code for America's organization brilliance is its willingness to try new things. The Rhode Island fellowship is an experiment in-and-of itself, in that it is the first time a fellowship has been attempted at the state level. Rhode Island may be a small state, but it is still very much a state and not a city.
  </p>
  <p>
    This brings some extra challenges for scalability and adoption of a project:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Larger geographic area to cover</li>
    <li>More organizational layers to consider</li>
    <li>Philosophical debates about what should be operated at the state and local levels</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To address these challenges, the following strategies are being employed:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pilot applications in specific cities before attempting state adoption</li>
    <li>
      Project ideas should focus on specific problem domains as much as possible, limiting the number of stakeholders that need to buy-in
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Additionally, when pairing the broad topics of state government and education, there are many areas that could be tackled: open data, civic engagement, digital services, and much more. However, all of the fellowship team's projects focus on two areas that often go hand-in-hand: relationships and efficiency. All of the projects have the theme of improving the first impression or continuing relationship that residents of Rhode Island have with the school system. The better interactions are created through pleasant user focused interfaces, but also by making these interactions more efficient (for both residents and administrators).
