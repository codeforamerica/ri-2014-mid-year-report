      <p>
        The first state accepted into the Code for America fellowship program, Rhode Island is currently investigating how open source software can empower its education ecosystem. In January, the State&rsquo;s Office of Digital Excellence tasked three fellows with exploring ways to improve parental engagement, highlight educational resources within the State, reduce brain drain, and bridge the digital divide. Over the past few months, the fellows have collaboratively devised a number of solutions with a handful of cities in hopes that their efforts will eventually scale statewide.

          Despite the relatively modest size (~1 million) of the population, Rhode Island has <a href="http://www.ride.ri.gov/StudentsFamilies/RIPublicSchools/SchoolDistricts.aspx">54 different Local Education Agencies (LEAs)</a>, or districts, each with its own unique challenges and opportunities. During the month of February, the fellows met with school faculty and staff, policy makers, thought leaders, and community members&mdash;over 150 people&mdash;to find common challenges across the state. In addition, the fellows ran several focus groups at schools. By March the team generated over 180 project ideas (they&rsquo;ve since been <a href="#projects">significantly narrowed</a>).

        <p>
          In addition to the interviews they conducted, the fellows helped organize and launch a local Code for America chapter, or <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/">Brigade</a>, during the month of February. The Brigade&rsquo;s first meeting coincided with a national event known as Code Across. Rhode Island&rsquo;s Code Across drew over 60 people from the local community (including developers, designers, State employees, impassioned community members and Providence&rsquo;s Chief Information Officer), demonstrating that Rhode Island is hungry for opportunities to connect and collaborate. By the event&rsquo;s end, the Brigade had devised a small group of projects to work on at future meetings.

        <p>
          More recently, during the month of March, the fellows used wireframes and prototypes to collaboratively hone their area of focus. They returned to Rhode Island in April to conduct (<a href="http://www.ideo.com/">IDEO</a>-inspired) tests groups with students, teachers, and administrators. Along the way, they met with school support staff, including family outreach coordinators and school secretaries. This eventually led to the project that gained the most traction during the months of May and June: digitizing student registration.

        <p>
          Part of Code for America&rsquo;s organizational brilliance is its willingness to try new things. And being the organization&rsquo;s first partnership at the state-level, the Rhode Island fellowship is particularly exemplary in this regard.</p>

          <p>Rhode Island may be small, but it presents Code for America with unprecedented problems, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A larger geographic area to cover (for in-person meetings).</li>
          <li>More hierarchical layers to consider.</li>
          <li>More organizational diversity at each layer.</li>
          <li>Increased attention to the ways that software limits or promotes political autonomy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To address these challenges, the fellows have employed a two-part strategy. First, the fellows will address problem domains that are as specific as possible. This will limit the number of stakeholders that need to buy-in to any given initiative. Second, the fellows will pilot their applications in specific cities to learn and adapt their applications before attempting state-wide adoption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Numerous avenues of inquiry lie at the intersection of civic-technology and education, including: open data, civic engagement, digital services, and much more. However, all of this fellowship team&rsquo;s projects focus on two important aspects of the civic-tech movement: relationships and efficiency. All of the projects have the theme of improving the first impression or continuing relationship that residents of Rhode Island have with the school system. The better interactions are created through pleasant user experiences, but also by making these interactions more efficient (for both residents and administrators).

            <h2>Ticket to RIDE</h2>
            <p>
              Making student registration electronic in a whimsical way can help create a better first impression that guardians have with their child&rsquo;s school district. Ticket to RIDE (RIDE = <em>R</em>.<em>I</em>. <em>D</em>epartment of <em>E</em>ducation) is an application that turns the registration forms into a series of prompts to be answered during a train trip. Guardians are prompted for information about their child, themselves, their family situation (such as the need for free/reduced lunch), and the people that are connected to their families.
            </p>

            <h3>Opportunities</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <em>Humanizing Experience</em>: 
                While the current paper forms currently used get the job done, a colorful and friendly request for registration information is a way to make guardians and their children feel more welcome and valued. The registration process is an opportunity to start the tone of the family/school relationship in a positive light, especially for guardians that may have felt disenfranchised during their own school years.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>Efficiency</em>:
                Depending on the school district, it takes guardians anywhere from 15 to 60 minutes to complete registration forms. Much of this time is spent repeating information across pieces of paper, such as student&rsquo;s name and address. Additionally, school secretaries need about 15 minutes to transcribe the forms into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_information_system">Student Information System</a> (SIS). By cutting down on repeat fields and reducing manual data entry, much time can be saved, especially in larger school districts.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>Standardization</em>:
                Although each school district is reponsible for creating its own registration forms, many districts inevitably collect the same bits of information. They just do it in a different way. Standardizing this process not only removes the burden (and ambiguity) from individual school districts, it also allows RIDE to collect a consistent and reliable set of information around enrollment.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>Environmentally/Cost Friendly</em>:
                The Cranston Public Schools enroll about 1000 kindergarteners each year. If there are five pieces of paper in each registration packet, this cuts down the amount of paper used by the school district. And, that&rsquo;s just one school district and one grade level.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Strategy</h3>
            <p>
              The team started by collecting registration packets from several of the largest school districts in Rhode Island and determining what fields are in common on their enrollment forms. Additionally, the schools were consulted to see which pieces of information were left on paper copies and which were transcribed into their SIS. This analysis produced a list of data points that all schools relied on, but also which pieces of information are needed in some districts, but not others (such as Newport that collects military information because of the base in town and their funding). Additionally, the team determined the two most popular SISs used across the state (schools are mandated to use one of three) and identified schools that used them.
            </p>
            <p>
              After creating a high-fidelity prototype, the team returned to Rhode Island to present it to several school districts to see if they'd be interesting in piloting the app and supporting its development through feedback and teaching us about their SIS import processes. Several school districts agreed to help, including <a href="http://cpsed.net/">Cranston</a>, <a href="http://www.npsri.net/">Newport</a>, <a href="http://www.westwarwickpublicschools.com/">West Warwick</a>, and the <a href="http://www.paulcuffee.org/">Paul Cuffee Charter School</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The strategy going forward includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Learn the import process used by Aspen and Skyward (the two most populare SISs in RI)</li>
              <li>Identify customizations that schools have made to their SIS data models</li>
              <li>Perform more user testing with guardians</li>
              <li>Complete development of the guardian facing interface based on feedback</li>
              <li>Develop an administrative interface that allows registration verification and export to the schools' SISs</li>
              <li>Determine the project sustainer (either RIDE or RI Office of Digital Excellence)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Chances are if you are reading this, then you know how to use a computer and if you were asked to find computer classes, you might Google for it. Now imagine that you want to take a computer class, but don't possess the skills to search for one online or simply don't have a computer. It&rsquo;s almost a chicken-and-egg problem for those without digital literacy and reveals a problem when trying to point folks without access to digital resources.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, about <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/mobile-technology-fact-sheet/">90%</a> of adults in the USA have cell phones (~98% of adults 18-49 have cell phones). This presents a large opportunity to reach this population.
            </p>
            <p>
              MultiplyRI is an SMS-based system that allows people with cell phones to locate computers, find a cheap Internet service provider, or locate digital literacy classes by sending a text message containing their address.

            <p><em>
              This is a potential project, should the fellows find time to do within the space of the fellowship year.
            </em></p>
            <p>
              In Rhode Island, a child&rsquo;s ability to attend a State sponsored pre-kindergarten program is determined by lottery per school. To make this a more fair process, RIDE has created a standardized lottery sign-up form. However, if a guardian wants to enter his/her child into multiple lotteries, this form needs to be filled out multiple times. A quick win is to create an electronic version of this form where a guardian can enter information once and apply to multiple schools.ß
            </p>

            <h3>Strategy</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Create electronic version of the form for data collection</li>
              <li>Implement an electronic version alongside the paper process</li>
              <li>Eventually, run the lottery programmatically</li>

            </em></p>
            <p>
              One of the prototypes that the team drew up early in the brainstorming process was a simple app that allowed teachers to complete exit surveys of their class. It involved students choosing an emotion (happy, frustrated, sad, excited, etc.) and explaining what about a day&rsquo;s class made them feel this way. Not only does it help teachers gauge the feeling of their class, but it can also help them identify children that are feeling isolated or may need extra help to stay engaged.
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea was really well received by focus groups conducted in April, but the uncertainty of who would own such an app within government was unclear and it was not made as the primary focus of the fellowship. During a visit back to RI in June, lots of folks asked about the app and the team may create it as a quick win, despite its unclear future.

              During the course of the fellowship thus far, the team has had exposure to many edtech and general tech vendors. Between this and getting a better understanding of school&rsquo;s challenges, this have given the team a unique perspective into which existing products are most apt to suite their needs. This has allowed the team to make suggestions to schools and RIDE.

            <img src="images/choose2matter.jpg"/>
            <p>
              The Rhode Island Fellows and Thom were mentors at the <a href="http://choose2matter.org/">Choose2Matter</a> all-day event at <a href="http://www.egsd.net/HighSchool.cfm?subpage=620381">East Greenwich High School</a> in February. The event, which is organized by Angela Maiers, seeks to teach students skills relevant to the modern world by inspiring them to determine issues that break their heart. From there, they work on a call to action, develop an action plan, work with experts and professionals, review plans, and start to implement them.

            <img src="images/code_across_group.jpg"/>
            <p>
              The fellows helped organize Code Across 2014 in Providence. Attending Code Across were developers, designers, State employees, impassioned community members and Providence&rsquo;s CIO. The event demonstrated that the RI community was hungry for a way to become involved in civic tech.
            </p>
            <p>
              The even was hosted in Rhode Island&rsquo;s beautiful State House (think: capitol) and was run as an ideathon. By just having the event generate ideas, it allowed many members of the community other than just developers to become involved and helped create initial directions for the new Brigade to pursue.

              The Code Island Brigade hosted its first <a href="http://hackforchange.org">NDoCH</a> event, a <a href="http://localwiki.net/ri/">LocalWiki</a> writeathon. The event was attended by Brigade members and created a framework for a RI LocalWiki instance by drafting a city/town/municipality outline for the state. After the outline was created, folks started writing articles about the different areas and things to do in them.

              <a href="http://www.businessinnovationfactory.com/">The Business Innovation Factory</a> launched a teacher professional development series called TD4ED which emphasizes using design thinking to improve schools. Design thinking is a huge tenant of Code for America, so the fellows and Thom joined several of the teacher teams for their first day, lending some experience and feedback on using empathy when trying to solve a problem and accomplish a goal.
