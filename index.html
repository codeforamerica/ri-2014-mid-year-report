  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <p>
    As the first state to be accepted to the Code for America fellowship program, Rhode Island brought three fellows in to explore how technology and design thinking can help empower people in the education systems. The State’s Office of Digital Excellence encouraged the fellows to explore areas around parent engagement, highlighting educational resources within the State, preventing brain drain, and supporting those caught on the “wrong side” of the digital divide - among others. The fellows were tasked to find solutions that could be iterated on within one or two school districts, then attempt to scale those solutions across the state.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite its modest population for a state (~1 million), Rhode Island has a large school system, supporting 54 public LEAs (Local Education Agencies or districts) -- each with its own challenges. During the month of February, the fellows sought out educators, support staff, education policy makers, education thought leaders, and community members to find common challenges that could help across the state. This resulted in meeting over 140 people and running several focus groups at schools. In April, the fellows identified three project areas that would help better connect schools to their communities.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to their interviews in February, the fellows helped launch a Statewide Code for America Brigade and organized Code Across 2014 in Providence. Code Across drew around 60 people from the community including developers, designers, State employees, impassioned community members and Providence’s CIO. The event demonstrated that the RI community was hungry for a way to become involved in civic tech and seeded the Brigade with some initial projects.

        Anna-Marie is a full stack web developer who loves fleshing out vague concepts and turning them into elegant and simple interface designs. When she’s not coding you can find her paddling on the San Francisco Bay or capturing dancers in mid-air with her camera. She studied journalism and urban studies at Northwestern University.

      <p>
        Hailing from Philadelphia, Jeff is a software developer (read: nerd) who likes using his coding skills for good. Before joining Code for America, Jeff helped create a web platform for diabetes data at Johnson &amp; Johnson, a crowd-sourced vacant parcel tracker called Reclaim Philly (via the Code for Philly Brigade), and a bike parking locator. When he's not civic coding, Jeff escapes from his computer screen with travel, hiking, and biking.
